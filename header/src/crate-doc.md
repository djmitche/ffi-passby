This crate supports generating a C header for a library crate, directly in the library itself.

Typically the crate would be annotated with ffizz_header macros to define the header content.
Then, the header is generated by calling [`generate`].

# Generating Headers

What follows is a simple, effective way to generate the header file, using the excellent [cargo-xtask](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask/).
With this in place, simply run `cargo xtask codegen` to generate the header file.
The file can either be checked in (in which case CI should verify that it is up-to-date), or generated as part of the release / packaging process.

## Setup

In your library's top level, add a call to 

```ignore
#[cfg(debug_assertions)] // only include this in debug builds
/// Generate the header
pub fn generate_header() -> String {
    ffizz_header::generate()
}
```

Set up an xtask project as described in [the project's documentation](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask/).
Add your library as a dependency of the xtask crate.
In `xtask/src/main.rs`, for a `mysupercool-lib` crate:

```ignore
use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    let manifest_dir = PathBuf::from(env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap());
    let workspace_dir = manifest_dir.parent().unwrap();

    // assume the mysupercool-lib crate is in `lib/`..
    let lib_crate_dir = workspace_dir.join("tests").join("lib");
    let mut file = File::create(lib_crate_dir.join("mysupercoollib.h")).unwrap();
    write!(&mut file, "{}", ::mysupercool_lib::generate_header()).unwrap();
}
```

You may wish to improve on this impementation, with proper command-line parsing and error handling.

## Caveats

This method does not support producing multiple header files for a single workspace.
Rust refuses to link them, due to duplicate symbols.
If your workspace contains multiple libraries, another option is to build a binary for each one, that generates the header file for only that library.
